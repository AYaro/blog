# Dev blog

Hey! I'm planning to start my own dev blogging platform, where I and some other IT enthusiasts will bring up some interesting topics and make different tutorials (mostly web dev and ethical hacking). 
Hopefully, the first release will be up and running by 15th of June.

Features of first release:
 - multilingual support (English, Russian)
 - view count
 - likes
 - tags 
 - intuitive minimalistic design (hopefully)
 - author pages

Features for future releases:
 - RSS feed
 - comments
 - contextual search
 - dark theme
 - easter eggs

NOTE: this repo is only for the backend of the service, i'm not planning to make the frontend public yet
